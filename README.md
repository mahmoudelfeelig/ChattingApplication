# ChattingApplication

A simple socket-based client-server chat application written in Python. This project demonstrates basic networking concepts using TCP sockets and threading, allowing multiple clients to connect to a single server, send messages, and receive responses in real-time.

## Key Features

- Multi-client support via threading
- Client name auto-assignment on connection
- Server responds to client messages with uppercase echo
- Graceful disconnection with `"CLOSE SOCKET"` command
- Real-time console logging of chat events
- Bi-directional messaging between server and clients

## Project Structure

```text
ChattingApplication/
├── client.py   # Client-side logic (connect, send/receive, close)
├── server.py   # Server-side logic (listen, handle clients, broadcast)
├── main.py     # Entry point, launches server with input thread
└── .idea/      # IDE config folder (can be ignored)
```

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Server

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start listening on `localhost:56040` and wait for incoming client connections.

### 2. Start a Client

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
python client.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the server IP (type `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` for local testing), then type `CONNECT` to join the server.

You can open multiple terminals and repeat the process to connect multiple clients concurrently.

## Commands

- Send any message to the server: the server will echo it back in **UPPERCASE**.
- Type `CLOSE SOCKET` from the client: gracefully disconnects from the server.
- Type messages directly in the server terminal: the server can broadcast to all clients as `Server: your message`.

## Notes

- All communication is in UTF-8 over TCP.
- Ports and host settings are hardcoded but can be modified easily.
- No GUI is implemented. This is a CLI-based chat tool for educational purposes.

## Educational Goals

This project is ideal for:

- Understanding Python socket programming
- Learning multi-threaded server design
- Practicing message broadcasting and real-time communication
- Experimenting with TCP/IP protocols
